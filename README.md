# delta_teleprompter
Teleprompter application which can show the script (for example your next YouTube video).
It uses SDL and True Type Font. It is very lightweight: it can run on Raspberry Pi Zero without any X Window System (X.org).
It can be started from command line automatically when OS boots.
